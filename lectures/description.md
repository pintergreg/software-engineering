The goal of this course is to provide common ground in software engineering for students with different backgrounds.
It aims to provide a shared terminology for experts in business informatics to be able to work seamlessly with software developers.
The course introduces the basics of modern software development methodologies and life cycles models, considering scrum and kanban in details
It focuses on requirement analysis and the software architecture, also in practise.
As a part of the practical classes, the students explore and document the requirements of a software system, then in the second part of the semester, they design its architecture.
For requirement analysis, it applies user story mapping in accordance with the agile principles.
For the software design, the course applies the C4 model, which is a set of hierarchical diagrams to describe the architecture of a software system.
The practical classes are workshops, where the students work in teams on the project assignment with the aid of the instructor.
