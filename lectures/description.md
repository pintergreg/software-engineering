The goal of this course is to provide a common foundation in software engineering for students from various backgrounds.
It aims to provide a shared terminology that enables experts in business informatics to be able to work seamlessly with software developers.
The course introduces the fundamentals of modern software development methodologies and life cycle models, with a focusing in detail on Scrum and Kanban.
The course covers requirements analysis and software architecture, both in theory and in practice.
During the practical classes, the students explore and document the requirements of a software system.
Then, during the second half of the semester, they design its architecture.
For requirements analysis, the course applies user story mapping in accordance with the agile principles.
For the software design, the course uses the C4 model, which is a set of hierarchical diagrams describing the architecture of a software system.
The practical classes are workshops in which the students work in teams on the project assignment under an instructor's guidance.
The During the second half of the semester, lectures also cover topics such as code quality, code review, testing and automation.
