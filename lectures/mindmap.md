## SDLC

### waterfall 

- earliest SDLC model
- progress flows in one direction
- not iterative, not flexible
- linear, sequential phases
- later it was extended with feedback loops

### V Model

- rigid model
- each phase has output and a review process
    - errors are found at early stage
    - decreases the risk of failure
- large to small: testing is done in a hierarchical perspective

### iterative model

- software is built incrementally
    - with each iteration adding new features or refining existing ones
- possible to get feedback after each iteration
- can be rigid within an iteration

### agile

#### manifesto

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

#### scrum

- roles
    - scrum master
        - developer representative

#### kanban

- pull-based system
- uses a visual workflow
- uses columns for states of the product
- continuous flow (not iterative)
- no roles, no events
- pick top right task
- encourages to improve the workflow

#### extreme programming

- frequent releases, short development cycles
- intended to improve productivity and
- introduce checkpoints for customer requirements
- features
    - pair programming
    - doing extensive code review
    - unit testing of all code
    - not programming features until they are actually needed
    - flat management structure

## requirement analysis

- understanding what software is supposed to do
- avoid costly mistakes early
- enhanced product quality
- better risk management
- steps
    - stakeholder identification
        - not just the customers
        - end user (groups)
    - elicitation of requirements
        - interviews
        - questionnaires
        - user observation
            - telemetry
    - documentation of requirements
        - for who
            - future self
            - colleagues
            - every stakeholder of the project
        - how
            - searchable
            - version tracked
            - traceable
                - who wrote / edited / approved it
    - analysis and negotiation
        - reviewing the documented requirements
        - make sure they are realistic and its implications are understood
    - validation and verification
        - validation
            - confirming the requirements actually meet the stakeholders' needs
            - are we building the right thing?
        - verification
            - making sure the requirements are documented correctly and consistently
            - are we building the thing right?
- requirement smells
    - indicate something not necessarily wrong but potentially problematic
    - subjective language
    - ambiguous adverbs and adjectives
    - non-verifiable terms
- functional requirements
    - features
- non-functional requirements
    - quality goals
    - quality of service requirements
- user story
    - simple description of a feature
    - from the user's perspective
    - often accompanied by acceptance criteria
        - define the conditions that must be met to be considered complete

### user story mapping

- performed in workshops
- build a shared understanding
- user story map
    - three levels
        - activities
            - big thing that users do
            - has multiple steps

## design

### unified modelling language

- structural diagrams
    - class
        - describes the structure of a system
        - main building block of the object-oriented modeling
    - object
        - represents the objects and their relationships at a specific moment
        - snapshot
        - does not show anything architecturally different to class diagram
    - component
        - depicts the component structure and relations
        - highlights the interfaces
- behavior diagrams
    - use case
        - depicts the interactions between system users
        - high-level view
        - similar to a user story
        - helping stakeholders to understand the system's functionality
    - activity
        - represents workflows
        - similar to flowchart
        - parallel processing
        - swimlanes
    - state machine
        - shows the states of a system
        - shows transitions between states
        - shows the system's life cycle
    - sequence
        - process interactions arranged in time sequence
        - shows objects
        - message exchange between software systems
    - timing
        - chronological order of events
        - useful in real-time systems
        - more like for documentation rather than modelling

### C4

- hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams
- has four levels
    - context
        - how the software fits into the world
        - who use the software
        - what other software interacts with
        - similar to use case diagram
        - understandable for non-technical people
    - containers
        - zooms into the software system, shows its parts
        - technology decisions are a key part
    - components
        - decomposition of each container
        - shows components, their interactions and responsibilities
        - also shows technology / implementation details
        - roughly equivalent with the UML component diagram
    - code
        - optional level of detail
        - ideally automatically generated
        - if required, it can zoom into an individual component
        - but show only those attributes and methods that really needed for the storytelling
        - UML class diagram can be used

### wireframing

- UI/UX designers' responsibility
- iterative process
    - presented to the stakeholders
    - feedback
- wireframe
    - outline / blueprint / concept art
    - visual understanding 
        - structure, layout, user flow, functionality and intended behaviours
    - low fidelity
        - first sketch
        - simple
        - don't include actual content
        - don't consider scale or pixel accuracy
        - can be hand-drawn
    - mid fidelity
        - more details
        - usually no images, typography
        - no colors, grayscale
        - usually made with digital tool
    - high fidelity
        - finalising the design
            - can be an initial prototype
        - created using a digital tool
        - pixel-specific layouts
        - has actual typography, 
        - detailed design elements (logos)
- wireframe map
    - shows user flow

### interface

- like an agreement
- shared boundary across two or more components
- a boundary where a module can be separated
- separation of concerns
- hides inner details
- communicate change
    - between teams during design
    - API level
    - code level
