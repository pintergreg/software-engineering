## SDLC

### waterfall 

- earliest SDLC model
- progress flows in one direction
- not iterative, not flexible
- linear, sequential phases
- later it was extended with feedback loops

### V Model

- rigid model
- each phase has output and a review process
    - errors are found at early stage
    - decreases the risk of failure
- large to small: testing is done in a hierarchical perspective

### iterative model

- software is built incrementally
    - with each iteration adding new features or refining existing ones
- possible to get feedback after each iteration
- can be rigid within an iteration

### agile

#### manifesto

- individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- working software over comprehensive documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to change over following a plan

## design

### unified modelling language

- structural diagrams
    - class
        - describes the structure of a system
        - main building block of the object-oriented modeling
    - object
        - represents the objects and their relationships at a specific moment
        - snapshot
        - does not show anything architecturally different to class diagram
    - component
        - depicts the component structure and relations
        - highlights the interfaces
- behavior diagrams
    - use case
        - depicts the interactions between system users
        - high-level view
        - similar to a user story
        - helping stakeholders to understand the system's functionality
    - activity
        - represents workflows
        - similar to flowchart
        - parallel processing
        - swimlanes
    - state machine
        - shows the states of a system
        - shows transitions between states
        - shows the system's life cycle
    - sequence
        - process interactions arranged in time sequence
        - shows objects
        - message exchange between software systems
    - timing
        - chronological order of events
        - useful in real-time systems
        - more like for documentation rather than modelling

### C4

- hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams
- has four levels
    - context
        - how the software fits into the world
        - who use the software
        - what other software interacts with
        - similar to use case diagram
        - understandable for non-technical people
    - containers
        - zooms into the software system, shows its parts
        - technology decisions are a key part
    - components
        - decomposition of each container
        - shows components, their interactions and responsibilities
        - also shows technology / implementation details
        - roughly equivalent with the UML component diagram
    - code
        - optional level of detail
        - ideally automatically generated
        - if required, it can zoom into an individual component
        - but show only those attributes and methods that really needed for the storytelling
        - UML class diagram can be used

### wireframing

- UI/UX designers' responsibility
- iterative process
    - presented to the stakeholders
    - feedback

        - structure, layout, user flow, functionality and intended behaviours
    - low fidelity
        - first sketch
        - simple
        - don't include actual content
        - don't consider scale or pixel accuracy
        - can be hand-drawn
    - mid fidelity
        - more details
        - usually no images, typography
        - no colors, grayscale
        - usually made with digital tool
    - high fidelity
        - finalising the design
            - can be an initial prototype
        - created using a digital tool
        - pixel-specific layouts
        - has actual typography, 
        - detailed design elements (logos)
- wireframe map
    - shows user flow

### interface

- like an agreement
- shared boundary across two or more components
- a boundary where a module can be separated
- separation of concerns
- hides inner details
- communicate change
    - between teams during design
    - API level
    - code level

### architecture decision record

- capture the decision
- helps to understand why the feature is built in a way and not some other way
- form of communication
    - for the future you
    - for colleagues

            - classes should be open for extension and closed to modification
        - Liskov substitution principle
            - classes should be able to substituted by subclasses without disrupting the behavior
        - interface segregation principle
            - client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
            - clients should not be forced to implement a function they do no need
        - dependency inversion principle
            - modules should depend on interfaces (or abstract classes), not concrete classes
    - DRY
        - don't repeat yourself
    - YAGNI
        - you aren't gonna need it
        - originates from extreme programming
        - do not add functionality until needed

            - behavioral
    - functional
        - filter-map-reduce
        - monad
- architectural principles
    - coupling and cohesion
        - coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules
        - low coupling often correlates with high cohesion
    - dependencies
    - boundaries

        - similar to onion
    - hexagonal
        - ports and adapters
        - isolates responsibilities
        - focus on interface definition
        - inner structure is not defined 
        - extra effort for port-adapter implementation
- architectural patterns
    - model-view-controller
        - view is responsible for rendering UI
        - controller handles the user input and performs interactions on the data model
        - model is responsible for managing the data
        - view is monolithic
        - view and the model are tightly coupled
        - multiple views
    - model-view-presenter
        - desktop
        - one view
        - view hamdles input
    - model-view-viewmodel

    - planning poker
        - gamified technique
        - make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down
            - avoid the cognitive bias of anchoring
                - first number spoken aloud sets a precedent
        - estimates are then discussed 
            - high and low estimates are explained
        - consensus-based
            - repeat until estimates converge
