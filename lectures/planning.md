# Brooks's law

> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.

::: {.fragment}
Assigning more programmers to a project running behind schedule will make it even later.
This is because the **time required for the new programmers to learn about the project** and the **increased communication overhead** will consume an ever-increasing quantity of available time [@enwiki:1233664045].

::: notes
Furthermore, in many cases the new programmer cannot just learn about the project on their own, but someone should mentor them.
This may be considered as a part of the communication overhead, it is an important aspect.
