# program is like a recipe

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="60%" .column-align-left}
- executing a program is following a recipe
- programming is like creating a recipe

::: {.fragment data-fragment-index="1"}
- software development is like running a restaurant
    - come up with recipes,
    - cook the food,
    - ingredient logistics and preparation,
    - food serving,
    - marketing,
    - cleaning

# software development often compared to house building

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="60%"}
- because it is an engineering discipline
- but software does not have to obey the laws of physics
- software design should focus only on the data structures and the connection between the modules
    - not the implementation details<br>(e.g., hardware)

# software development is more like gardening

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="60%"}
- a garden might be planned
- external factors influence the result
    - weather, pests
- garden needs constant care to bloom
- sometimes also experimentation
    - methods, tools
- garden is like an art (with function)

# software growth

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="60%"}
- number of lines of code is increasing
    - which increases complexity
- "every line of code written comes at a price: maintenance" [@tef2016write]
    - larger garden, more gardening
- software development processes to handle the complexity
