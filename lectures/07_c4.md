# what is the issue with UML?

- closely connected with OOP
- propagates object-oriented modelling
    - however the design should not consider the implementation

# C4 model

- hierarchical set of software architecture diagrams
    - different levels of abstraction for different audience
- has four levels:
    - context, containers, components and code
- popularized by Simon Brown

# Level 1: System Context diagram

- high level relation with other systems or users
- similar to use case diagram
- technologies, protocols and other low-level details are not important
- understandable for non-technical people

> Shows the software system you are building and how it fits into the world in terms of the people who use it and the other software systems it interacts with.
>
>  Simon Brown - [The C4 Model for Software Architecture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/C4-architecture-model/)

# Level 2: Container diagram

> Zooms into the software system, and shows the containers (applications, data stores, microservices, etc.) that make up that software system. Technology decisions are also a key part of this diagram.

# Level 3: Component diagram

> Zooms into an individual container to show the components inside it. These components should map to real abstractions (e.g., a grouping of code) in your codebase.

# Level 4: Code

> Finally, if you really want or need to, you can zoom into an individual component to show how that component is implemented.

# additional diagrams in C4 model

- system landscape diagram
    - even broader environment than the system context diagram
- dynamic diagram
    - based on the UML communication and sequence diagrams
- deployment diagram
    - based on the UML deployment diagram
<!--    - audience: technical people inside and outside of the software development team
        - software architects, developers, infrastructure architects, and operations/support staff-->

## dynamic diagram (collaboration style)

## deployment diagram

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="40%" .text-smaller}
- shows where an instance of a software system is running e.g., 
    - physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device)
    - virtualised infrastructure,
    - containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container),
    - an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc.
- deployment nodes can be nested
