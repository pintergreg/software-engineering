# the project

An event organizer company entrusts your software development company to create a drone show choreography designer software.
They have just bought 256 drones and they want to be able to do smaller-scale drone shows on parties, birthdays and weddings.

The software should be able to manage the position of every drone in a given space in respect of the time.
Every drone is capable of switch on RGB LEDs with a given light intensity.
The software should be able to manage not just the position, but the state (light) of the drone.

The software generates a trajectory for every drone that it will follow.

Your task is to design this software.

## work in agile methodology

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="65%"}
- imagine how you would use a software like this
    - what functions would you need
- identify dependencies between the functions / modules
- plan sprints with usable increments
- deadline: 2024-12-03 (week 13)
    - when the team also presents the design as a presentation
- practical classes are workshops
    - possible feedback from the instructor
- **NO CODING**
