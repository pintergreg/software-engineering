# flashcard application requirements

- Android and iOS (tablets should be supported)
    - at least 5 years old devices should be supported
- offline app, no subscription plans, one-time payment via the store
- how the words are groupped
    - by chapters of the textbook
- the customer provides a wordlist (with meaning) for each chapter
    - in Excel format (xlsx)
- user will not be able to add new words
- there is only one interface language
    - the majority language of the country

## requirements part 2

- logo of the language association should appear on the main screen
- GUI customization: light/dark theme, font size settings
- a learning mode is required, which just goes through the words of a chapter
- and a practicing mode, which selects words randomly from every group
    - words with more left-swipe should appear more frequent
    - if a word was swiped left, three right swipes needed to consider it learnt
- users should be able to check the statistics
    - progress bar (learnt words / total)
    - which days they learned in the last month, how many cards they've learnt

# Level 1: System Context diagram

:::::::::::: {.columns}
::::::::: {.column width="70%"}

- high level relation with other systems or users
- similar to use case diagram
- technologies, protocols and other low-level details are not important
- understandable for non-technical people

- this could be, for example, class diagram with UML
- we're skipping it (also not required for the project assignment)
